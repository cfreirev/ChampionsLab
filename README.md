## ❤️ Why Champions Lab?

We love Pokémon. Seriously — we've been playing VGC for years and we wanted to build the competitive companion we always wished existed. **Champions Lab is 100% free, has no ads, and no paywalls.** We built this during our free time because we believe every trainer deserves access to great tools, regardless of budget.

If you find it useful, share it with a friend. That's all the support we need.

> **Play it now at [championslab.xyz](https://championslab.xyz)**
